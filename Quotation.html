            <blockquote cites="https://hadoop.apache.org/">The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework th
                at allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using s
                imple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines,
                each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability,
                the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a
                highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.</blockquote>
